# Pushing to Multiple Git Remotes

Quick guide on pushing a local repo to both GitHub and Gitea (or any other remote). Useful for backing up code or working with different teams.

## Steps

1. Create new repos on GitHub and Gitea
   - Same repo name on both
   - Configure settings as needed

2. Add GitHub and Gitea as remotes in local repo
   ```
   git remote add github https://github.com/username/repo.git
   git remote add gitea https://gitea-instance.com/username/repo.git
   ```
   Replace `username`, `repo`, and `gitea-instance.com` with your own

3. Push local repo to both remotes
   ```
   git push github main
   git push gitea main
   ```
   Use your default branch name if not `main`

4. Double-check that the code is on both GitHub and Gitea

## How it works

Git lets you have multiple remotes, each with its own name. Adding GitHub and Gitea as separate remotes means you can push to both at the same time.

`git push github main` sends commits from local `main` to `main` on the GitHub remote. Same for Gitea.

Handy for keeping code synced across different platforms for backup, collaboration, or using features of each service.

## Tips

- Make sure to change `username`, `repo`, and `gitea-instance.com` to your actual values
- If you already pushed to one remote before adding the other, you might need to do this the first time:
  ```
  git push --set-upstream gitea main
  ```
- To make life easier, create a Git alias to push to both remotes at once:
  ```
  git config --global alias.pushall '!git push github main && git push gitea main'
  ```
  Then just do `git pushall`

And that's pretty much it! Now you can keep your code safe and synced on GitHub, Gitea, or any other remotes you want.
