# Running a PowerShell Script Automatically Using Task Scheduler

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a PowerShell script to run automatically using the Windows Task Scheduler.

## Prerequisites

- A PowerShell script that you want to run automatically.
- Administrative access to the Windows machine.

## Steps

1. Open the Task Scheduler:
   - Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog.
   - Type "taskschd.msc" and press Enter.

2. Create a new task:
   - In the Task Scheduler, click on "Create Task..." in the Actions pane on the right.
   - Give your task a name and description in the "General" tab.

3. Configure the trigger:
   - Switch to the "Triggers" tab and click "New..."
   - Choose the desired trigger type (e.g., Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or a specific date/time).
   - Set the trigger settings according to your requirements and click "OK."

4. Configure the action:
   - Switch to the "Actions" tab and click "New..."
   - In the "Action" dropdown, select "Start a program."
   - In the "Program/script" field, enter "powershell.exe"
   - In the "Add arguments (optional)" field, enter the following:
     ```
     -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\Script.ps1"
     ```
     Replace "C:\Path\To\Your\Script.ps1" with the actual path to your PowerShell script.
   - Click "OK" to save the action.

5. Set additional settings (optional):
   - In the "Conditions" tab, you can specify additional conditions for the task to run, such as only running when the computer is idle or when a network connection is available.
   - In the "Settings" tab, you can configure additional settings, such as deleting the task if it is not scheduled to run again or running the task with the highest privileges.

6. Save the task:
   - Click "OK" to save the task.

7. Test the task:
   - Right-click on the newly created task and select "Run."
   - Check if the PowerShell script executes as expected.

## Modifying or Deleting the Task

- To modify the task, double-click on it in the Task Scheduler Library and make the necessary changes in the task properties.
- To delete the task, right-click on it and select "Delete."

## Notes

- Make sure the PowerShell script has the necessary permissions to run and that the user account under which the task runs has sufficient privileges to execute the script.
- If the script requires administrative privileges, make sure to check the "Run with highest privileges" option in the "General" tab of the task properties.
- Be cautious when running scripts automatically, as they may have unintended consequences if not properly tested and validated.

By following these steps, you can set up a PowerShell script to run automatically using the Windows Task Scheduler, allowing you to automate various tasks and processes on your Windows machine.
