# Changing PowerShell Execution Policy

By default, PowerShell's execution policy is set to "Restricted," which prevents the execution of PowerShell scripts. To allow a user to run any PowerShell script, you need to change the execution policy.

## Changing the Execution Policy

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.

2. To set the execution policy to "Unrestricted," run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   ```

3. When prompted, type "Y" and press Enter to confirm the change.

   ```
   Execution Policy Change
   The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
   [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
   ```

4. Verify the new execution policy by running:

   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

   The output should be "Unrestricted."

## Reverting the Execution Policy Change

To revert the execution policy change and restore the default "Restricted" policy:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.

2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
   ```

3. When prompted, type "Y" and press Enter to confirm the change.

4. Verify the restored execution policy by running:

   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

   The output should be "Restricted."

## Notes

- Changing the execution policy to "Unrestricted" allows the execution of any PowerShell script, which can be a security risk. Only do this if you trust the scripts you intend to run.

- Alternative execution policies, such as "RemoteSigned" or "AllSigned," provide more security by requiring scripts to be digitally signed by a trusted publisher.

- The execution policy change affects the current user. To change the policy for all users, use the "-Scope" parameter followed by "LocalMachine" or "CurrentUser."

Always exercise caution when running scripts from untrusted sources, and make sure to understand the implications of changing the PowerShell execution policy.
