# Create an Ubuntu Server 22.04 VM using VirtualBox

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing and setting up an Ubuntu Server 22.04 VM using VirtualBox, including the installation of guest tools.

## Prerequisites

- VirtualBox installed on your host machine
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 ISO image downloaded

## Steps

1. Open VirtualBox and click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
2. Name the VM "Ubuntu Server 22.04" and choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64-bit)" as the version. Click "Next".
3. Allocate at least 2048 MB of RAM (more if available) and click "Next".
4. Choose "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create".
5. Select "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" and click "Next".
6. Choose "Dynamically allocated" and click "Next".
7. Allocate at least 20 GB of disk space and click "Create".
8. Right-click on the newly created VM and select "Settings".
9. In the "Storage" section, click on the "Empty" CD icon under "Controller: IDE" and select the Ubuntu Server 22.04 ISO image. Click "OK".
10. Start the VM and follow the Ubuntu Server installation prompts.
11. Once the installation is complete, reboot the VM and log in with your credentials.

## Installing Guest Additions

1. In the VirtualBox menu, click on "Devices" and select "Insert Guest Additions CD image".
2. In the Ubuntu Server VM, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
   cd /media/cdrom
   sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
   ```

3. Reboot the VM for the changes to take effect:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

Your Ubuntu Server 22.04 VM is now set up and ready to use, with guest tools installed for better performance and integration with the host machine.
